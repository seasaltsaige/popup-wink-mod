# Winkduino Headlight Controller

This project aims to be a "replacement" for the [MX-5 Tech](https://mx5tech.co.uk/wink-sleepy-eye-mod). While, for most people, simply purchasing this product is the correct choice, this will aim to achieve the same result at a lower cost, but a bit more effort, though this reposity serves as a detailed guide on how to install the device in your own car, hopefully removing a lot of the difficulty.

### DISCLAIMER:
This will modify, cut, and replace some of the cars wiring harness in the headlight motors. It is reversable, but not to 100% OEM standards. Do this at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage you cause to your car or yourself.

This project will involve solder fumes. These are dangerous to inhale. Wear a mask and eye protection while soldering, and do it in a well ventalated area.
