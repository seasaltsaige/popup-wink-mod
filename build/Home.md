# Getting Started

## Materials

- **Arduino Nano 33 BLE**: Main Controller. ([~$24](https://www.ebay.com/) or [~$29.30](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-33-ble-with-headers?queryID=609ff256f865f54a71149598cbcd2114&selectedStore=us))
- **4 Way 12V Relay**: Required for transmitting power to the headlights, as the Nano does not provide enough voltage. ([$6.95](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KTEN3TM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details))
- **Solder Breadboard**: Facilitates easy and secure connections during the setup. ([$2.25](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KTEN3TM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details))
- **Battery Bank**: Provides power to the Arduino when the car is turned off. ([$16.95](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JZCZSH9?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details))
- **12V to 5V DC to DC Power Converter**: Not a necessity, but if you want to set it and forget it, you'll want it to charge the battery bank while the car is running. ([$12.99](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SS6XTZY?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1))
- **Spade Connectors**: Allow for easy removal and semi-restoration of the stock wiring system. ([~$0.10 per connection](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BG1K5SL8?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details))
- **T-Junction tap**: Only a few will be needed, used to tap into a wire. ([~$0.07 per tap](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09YGH6FNQ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details))

- **Wire**: You can get any wire that you want, but it's recommended that you use insulated wire to protect from the hot environment in the engine bay.
I chose to go with dual core insulated wire. ([~$0.3 per foot](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5T5G2NH?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)) Additionally, 28-30AWG wire for the connections for the arduino. ([~$0.23 per foot](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G2SWB19?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)). Lastly, you will want a few jumper wires to connect to the headers of the relay switch. ([~$0.06 each](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GD1XFWV?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details))
