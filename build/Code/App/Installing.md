# Installing your controller
Note: I only have an android phone to test and install this app on, so, unfortunately I can't help with people on iOS. The build process and upload process is likely similar though.

## Basic Install
Recommended for most people if you don't know anything about React Native and/or Expo. Unfortunately this is Android only. Sorry iOS, you'll want to follow the [Personal Install](#personal-install) and do your research for building to Apple devices.

You can head over to my [Expo Page](https://expo.dev/accounts/maxisthemoose/projects/winkduino/builds), and install the latest **preview** build artifact. 

Download the APK file, and open it on your phone. Google will likely tell you that the app is potentially dangerous, as I am not a certified developer, with no account to upload to the play store. If you do not trust the code, feel free to follow the [Personal Install](#personal-install) instead. Otherwise, you can allow the app, and install it onto your device.

All done!
